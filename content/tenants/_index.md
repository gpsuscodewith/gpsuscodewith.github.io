# Core Tenants / Principals

## Context
This document describes the core tenants of the GPS Code-with team. These tenants help direct the team's enagement model with GPS partners with whom we are co-engineering, as well as between other team members. They should be referenced regularly to guide technical decisions as well as day-to-day operations.

## Agile Manifesto Principals
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
1. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
1. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
1. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
1. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
1. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
1. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
1. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
1. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
1. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
1. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Follow Minimalism Rules
### (<http://minifesto.org/>)
* Fight for Pareto's law, look for the 20% of effort that will give you the 80% of results
* Prioritize, minimalism isn't about not doing things but about focusing first in the important
* Perfect is enemy of good, first do it, then do it right, then do it better
* Kill the baby, don't be afraid of starting all over again. Fail soon, learn fast
* Add value. Think constantly about how you can help your team and position yourself in that field/skill
* Basics, first. Follow always a top-down thinking starting by the best-practices of CS
* Think different. Simple is harder than complex, which means you'll need to use your creativity
* Synthesis is the key of communication. We have to write code for humans not machines
* Keep it plain. Try to keep your designs with few layers of indirection. Clean kipple and redundancy. Minimalism is all about removing distractions

## Team Implementations
* Verticle slicing over horizontal slicing
* Code has no owners
* Optimization should be driven by performance test data 
* Ask for help when blocked
* Use [clean coding pricipals](../clean-code/)
    * Right tool for the job
    * High signal to noise ratio
    * Self-documenting
