A project team should be made up of a few standard roles to ensure the integrity of the work. Each team member should own the responsibilities of that role, but also understand that the success of the project is the responsibility of everyone. If there is an attempt to be pro-active and help a teammate, you should do so.

## Roles

* Program Manager (of Code-with all up)
* Engagement Lead 
* Technical Lead / Architect
* DevOps Lead (optional)
* Software Engineer

### Engagement Lead  / Project Manager

No code-with engagement should be without a lead / dedicated project manager. Since the partner will be responsible for taking ownership of the developed solution at the end of the engagement, the project manager role should be filled by the partner. The project manager can take on a different name, depending on the type of development process the partner is using, but the responsilities should be the same. 

The core responsibilities of the Engagement Lead include:
* Capture customer requirements and translate them into user stories
* Prioritize user stories and bugs
* Lead daily scrum calls (if scrum is used)
* Remove organizational roadblocks
* Lead sprint planning meetings


### Technical Lead

The technical lead of a project serves as the voice of the technical team to the customer and acts as a "tiebreaker" when it comes to technical design decisions. The technical lead is well versed in the software architecture, tools, patterns, and tech stack that the project will be built with. 

To start, a technical lead should follow the [Tech Lead's Checklist](../engineering-fundamental-checklist). This will help with the engineering fundamentals.

### DevOps Lead

The DevOps Lead is an optional role in a code-with project as some partners may already have established DevOps practices and microservice teams that include DevOps in their software engineering roles.

When the DevOps lead role is filled by the GPS code-with team, the core responsibilities of the DevOps Lead are as follows:

* Make process and tools recommendations
* Educate/coach team members 
* Create reuasable DevOps assets
* Drive DevOps security

### Software Engineer

A software engineer on a GPS code-with is writes quality code utilizing best practices for maintainability, performance, and reuse.
