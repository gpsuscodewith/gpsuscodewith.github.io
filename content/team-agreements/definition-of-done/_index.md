  How do we define "Done"?
---

The intent of the Definition of Done is to ensure proper planning has taken place to assure a new product or feature is developed  “On-schedule, On-budget, and with an acceptable level of Quality”

## Definition of Done​
Is the culmination of completed Work-items and Sprints​

## Definition of Done criteria ​
Each project Work-item that is defined in each project Sprint of the project will meet the pre-defined “Definition of Done Criteria” identified in the planning stage of a code-with engagement​

## Definition of Done criteria​
Will be documented in the “User Story Acceptance Criteria“
