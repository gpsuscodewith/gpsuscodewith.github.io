The GPS code-with team will engage with partners that are high-value and meet a certain criteria that increases the chances of a successful engagement.

Partners should have the following in place to be considered for a code-with engagement:
* Successfully complete ADS and have a targeted architecture
* Optionally executed a hack or poc if there are questions about the architecture that need to be proven out
* Have a dedicated project mangager
* Will have running software in production, on Azure, at the end of the engagement
* Software will be written in one of the GPS code-with supported tech stacks

# Partner Selection Process
[Partner Selection Process](../partner-selection)

## Engagement
All GPS code-with projects will be run with an agile process such as Kanban or scrum.  Flexibility with partner processes will be encouraged as the partner will be responsible to owning and maintaining the solution going forward, but an agile process is required to increase the chances for success. Rapid value to the customer and immediate feedback will ensure effort is not wasted on the wrong things. 

During the execution of the engagement, the defined [roles](../roles) will be utilized throughout over the previously definied number of sprints.

## Handoff
At the end of the GPS code-with engagement, the partner will take ownership of the solution.  All support for the solution will take place through standard partner support channels, such as Premiere, that are set up for 24/7 support with assigned shifts to ensure timely response to support incidents.

## Retrospectives
After the solution has been officially handed off to the patner, the code-with team should have a final team retrospective summarizing the learnings from the engagement. These learnings should be both technical and non-tenical, and a summary of these learnings should be published to the GPS code-with Github repository to ensure these learnings can be accessed and put to use in future engagements.

## Technical Assets
Along with the retrospective summary, technical assets from this project may be identified for reuse across other GPS engagements, or for the open source community. If technical assets have been identified, it would be internally developed for public use.  For more information, please see [GPS Technical Assets](../technical-assets).
