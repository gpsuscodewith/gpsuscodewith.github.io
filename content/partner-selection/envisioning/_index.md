# Envisioning Agenda

The Code-with envisioning has the following structure:

* Architecture Review 
* Technical Deep Dives
* Backlog Review
* Next Steps / Planning

### 1. Architecture Review

The architecture review is partner-lead and covers the current architecture or proposed architecture (if one has already been chosen). The context is the 

-   high-level solution objectives and/or requirements
-   Team structures (of the partner) current or future
-   DevOps processes

For the architecture review, it is helpful if the partner is able to provide any materials that will help create the following session outputs:

* High-level timelines
* Team resources and roles
* User personas
* Functional requirements
* Non-functional requirements
* Integration points or dependencies
* SLA and high availability strategies
* Logical architecture diagrams
* DevOps process flow
* Software stack / frameworks


### 2. Technical Deep Dives

The technical deep dive is used to dig into the physical architecture of the current or proposed solution. There will be more focus on the non-functional requirements, software stacks, domain model, storage design, etc.

For the technical deep dive, it is helpful if the partner is able to provide any materials that will help create the following session outputs:
* Domain model
* Physical architecture
* Application Architecture at the component level
* Storage schema
* Migration requirements prior to development (data, source code, etc)


### 3. Backlog Review

During the backlog review, the team reviews (or creates collaboratively) the user stories.  During code-with sprints, the code-with team will work on user stories from the backlog, so the output of this session is a populated and understood backlog of user stories.  

The partner should be prepared to share and describe existing user stories / backlog items.  If there are no existing user stories in a backlog, this session will be focused on creating them.  

Key participants that should be present include the business/domain subject matter experts.

### 4. Next Steps / Planning

This session is meant to plan out the post-envisioning session and potentially schedule some initial code-with sprints.  There may be cases where partners need to set up their Azure environments, provision users according to their roles, or migrate any needed data or infrastructure resources.

The key output of this session is:

* Identify prerequisites for code-with engagement
* Schedule sprint 0

## Approaches to Delivery 

### Virtual 4-Session Agenda

A virtual series of four sessions is used to cover the envisioning and architectural design sessions.  This would be used as an alternative to an in-person, all-day Envisioning and Architectural Design Sessions process.  The four sessions would be segmented according to structure previously defined.

### In Person / All Day

The code-with team would arrange an onsite or agreed upon location to deliver the full envisioning with the partner.
