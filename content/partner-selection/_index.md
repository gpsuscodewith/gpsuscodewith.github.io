The partner selection process is designed to ensure that the GPS Code With team and the partner are properly aligned on goals and expectations. An initial discussion with the partner will be scheduled to educate the partner on the code with team and its engagement model. During this discussion, the partner opportunity will also be introduced to the code with team, covering the business drivers, high level timelines, partner staff resources dedicated to the project, potential tech stack, and how much existing software is expected to be reused.

If the initial call with the partner indicates that this could be a potential fit for both the partner and GPS, an envisioning session will be scheduled for a mutually agreed upon time.

## Envisioning
The envisioning phase in intended to gain a detailed technical understanding of the technical architecture, development practices, and environment, so that both the code with team and partner can make a descision on whether or not to move forward with scheduling the project. The envisioning phase is made up to two distinct sessions that can be scheduled consecutively or at different times. The two sessions are:
* Envisioning Session (1 day)
* Architectural Design Session (2-3 days)

### Envisioning Session
The envisioning session is a one day session focused on deeper review of the business drivers and team readiness to execute. By the end of the envisioning session, the OCP Code With team should have an in depth understanding of:
* Current and/or targeted DevOps practices
* User story backlog
* Executive sponsorship
* Partner project team resources including project manager and the number of dedicated engineers
* Production timelines
* Project budget
* Compliance requirements

### Architectural Design Session
The architecture design session phase of envisioning could typically last 2-3 depending on the level of depth that was covered by previous architecture design sessions with the partner. The architecture design session in the code-with envisioning phase usually dives deeper into the application layer rather than staying at the higher solution level. It is critical that the partner includes all relevant technical resources in the architectural design session so that unknowns are kept to a minimum when entering the development phase. The architectural design session is the main opportunity to ensure there are no delays or blockers early into the development phase due to unforseen issues or requirements.

By the end of the architectural design session, the GPS code-with team should have a solid understanding of the following:
* Non-functional requirements such as performance/scale targets, availability targets, etc. 
* Proposed solution architecture
* Application architecture at the component level
* Data-tier design/services
* Development stack / proposed technologies and tools
* Proposed DevOps process
* Testing strategies
* Infrastructure requirements
* Team dependencies
* Migration requirements prior to development (data, source code, etc)
* RBAC requirements for team members

## Post-Envisioning
At the end of the envisioning session, a go/no-go decision will be made so to wheter or not the project will be scheduled. Scheduling of the inital sprint will be based off both the partner/GPS availability, and any pre-requisite work that was identified during the envisioning phase.  Pre-requisite work would include things like:
* Environment setup
* User provisioning and permissions
* Migration of code/data to new environment
