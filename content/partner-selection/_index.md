## Qualification process

The GPS Code-with team will align with the parnter on goals and expectations. Initial discussions will be had that educate the partner on the Code-with team and how it engages. A technical strategist will see to understand and qualify things like:

- Business drivers and impacts
- High level timelines
- Development resources dedicated to the project
- The targeted technologies
- Existing software that will be integrated, expanded, or reused

## Preparation
Once these things have been understood, a representative from the Code-with team will engage and begin the process of preparation.

The planning phase in intended to gain a detailed technical understanding of the technical architecture, development practices, and environment, so that both the Ccde-with team and partner can make a descision on whether or not to move forward with scheduling the planning proces. This includes

- User story analysis, architectural and backlog review
- Scoping technial requirements 
- Execution of legal agreements with Microsoft
<!-- 
### Exit criteria
By the end of this process, a go/no-go decision is made to code with for the project, and initial scheduling is discussed. Scheduling accounts for both the Code-with and partner availability and pre-requisite work that may have been identified.   -->

## Planning
During planning, we will review the business drivers and team readiness to execute. By the end, the Code-with team should have an in depth understanding of:

* Current and/or targeted DevOps practices
* User story backlog
* Executive sponsorship
* Partner project team resources including project manager and the number of dedicated engineers
* Production timelines
* Project budget
* Compliance requirements

### Prerequisites
Prerequisite work would include things like:
* Environment setup
* User provisioning and permissions
* Migration of code/data to new environment

### Architectural design
The architecture design session phase of envisioning could typically last 2-3 depending on the level of depth that was covered by previous architecture design sessions with the partner. The architecture design session in the code-with envisioning phase usually dives deeper into the application layer rather than staying at the higher solution level. 

It is critical that the partner includes all relevant technical resources in the architectural design session so that unknowns are kept to a minimum when entering the development phase. The architectural design session is the main opportunity to ensure there are no delays or blockers early into the development phase due to unforseen issues or requirements.

By the end of the architectural design session, the GPS code-with team should have a solid understanding of the following:

* Non-functional requirements such as performance/scale targets, availability targets, etc. 
* Proposed solution architecture
* Application architecture at the component level
* Data-tier design/services
* Development stack / proposed technologies and tools
* Proposed DevOps process
* Testing strategies
* Infrastructure requirements
* Team dependencies
* Migration requirements prior to development (data, source code, etc)
* RBAC requirements for team members
