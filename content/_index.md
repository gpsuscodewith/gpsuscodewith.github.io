## Code-with Mission 

Code-with engagements are one-to-one deep, software development level activites with a partner that are consistent with Code-with Playbook principles to fulfill three goals:

1. Increase partner capability and shorten a partner's time to [production](./inprod.md), creating Azure consumption
2. Identity gaps or growth opportunities in product/services and collaborate with Product Group(s) and engineering to
3. Develop solutions at the tier 3 (public, broad partner impact, fundable) level 

Every partner will receive a consistent and compelling engagement to achieve their cloud migration or modernization goals while raising their capability in using Azure.
